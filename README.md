The Hindu RSS Reader is a lightweight, client-side web app that fetches The Hinduâ€™s RSS feeds via a CORS-friendly proxy and parses the XML with DOMParser to render headlines, summaries, links, dates, and optional authors in a clean, responsive layout. It supports multiple sections (Main, National, International, Business, Sports, Opinion, Entertainment), in-page keyword search, newest/oldest sorting, refresh, and preference persistence, all running entirely in the browser with no backend required. The project is built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and can be published as a static site using GitHub Pages for quick, hassle-free hosting and automatic redeploys on push.
